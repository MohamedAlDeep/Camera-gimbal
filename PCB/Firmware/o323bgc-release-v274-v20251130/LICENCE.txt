(c) www.olliw.eu

The STorM32 project consists of several parts, such as the STorM32 controller and 
NT modules hardwares, the STorM32 and NT modules firmwares, and the graphical user interface o323BGCTool.
This licence covers the terms of usage for the firmwares and the o323BGCTool graphical user interface. 
For the terms of usage of other parts please consult https://www.olliw.eu/storm32bgc-wiki/Terms_of_Use.


LICENCE/TERMS OF USAGE for o323bgc firmware:
--------------------------------------------
The STorM32 firmware is provided free of charge (i.e., is free as in “free beer” but not free as in “freedom"; 
it is not open source). It consists of the binaries for the main controller board and the NT modules. In 
addition to unrestricted private use, you are also granted permission to use the firmware for commercial 
purposes, provided that: (1) you do not modify the firmware in any way (e.g., remove or alter copyright statements),
(2) you provide it free of charge (e.g., do not impose any explicit or implicit fees on your customers), and
(3) you clearly and correctly acknowledge the use and origin of the firmware (e.g., in product documentation,
on your website, in interviews, and similar contexts).

Comment: Compliance with these terms of use is not merely a matter of netiquette, but a legal obligation,
especially also point (3). 

LICENCE/TERMS OF USAGE for o323BGCTool graphical user interface:
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Windows GUI (o323BGCTool) software is open source (but see below). In addition to unrestricted private use,
you are also granted permission to use the software for commercial purposes, provided that: (1) you do not
remove or change copyright statements, (2) you provide it free of charge (e.g., do not impose any explicit or
implicit fees on your customers), and (3) you clearly and correctly acknowledge the use and origin of the
software (e.g., in product documentation, on your website, in interviews, and similar contexts).

The Windows GUI software is written in Perl and relies on several libraries, such as Win32::GUI, most of which
are no longer actively maintained. Only the GUI’s source code is published; the libraries themselves are not
included, meaning that a fully working distribution is not provided. However, the published code contains all
the essential components needed to understand the software’s internal workings.
